# added more better way to handle errors
# i added "adduser " and "addteam"
# i forgot to define res in adduser in app.js,during fixing
#in sql, wrote "null" and "on delete set null"
#i realised , i made it such a way, i need to enter ids and not names to assign tasks
#i added delete and, date and time format changed
