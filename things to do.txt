🚀 Next-Level Features to Add
1. Advanced Authentication (Security Upgrade)

Add password hashing (e.g., bcrypt).

Add JWT refresh tokens and expiry handling.

Add role-based middleware (admin, user, manager).

Add forgot password (email reset link using Nodemailer).

👉 Why: Proves you understand real-world authentication flows.

2. Task Enhancements

Add subtasks (nested structure).

Add task comments & activity log (like “User X updated status to Done”).

Add priority levels (low, medium, high).

Add file attachments (e.g., upload docs using Multer + Cloudinary).

Add task reminders/notifications (e.g., send mail or in-app alert before deadline).

👉 Why: Makes it look like a real Asana/Jira clone.

3. Team & Collaboration Features

Allow team chat (simple WebSocket or Socket.IO channel).

Add team dashboard (summary of total tasks, completed %, active members).

Add invite system (admin adds users to teams via email).

👉 Why: Adds communication + teamwork — a hallmark of enterprise apps.

4. Analytics Dashboard

Use Chart.js or Recharts to visualize:

Number of tasks completed per user

Tasks by priority

Tasks over time (trend graph)

Team productivity stats

👉 Why: Turns raw data into management insight — FAANG apps love metrics.

5. Search & Filters

Add search bar (by task name, assignee, team).

Add filters (by status, deadline range, team).

👉 Why: Enhances UX, shows you understand database querying.

6. Performance & Architecture

Convert your DB logic into models using Sequelize or Prisma.

Use MySQL connection pooling (you’ve already started that 👏).

Add environment variables (dotenv).

Deploy backend + frontend separately (Render + Netlify/Vercel).

👉 Why: Demonstrates you can build scalable, production-grade systems.

7. UI/UX Enhancements

Add dark mode toggle.

Add loading animations, toast messages (e.g., success/error).

Responsive layout (Bootstrap / Tailwind).

Show live updates when new tasks are created (via Socket.IO).

👉 Why: Polished UX shows attention to detail — top engineers care about that.

8. AI Integration (Optional but Cool)

Integrate a task assistant:

“Summarize my pending tasks.”

“Suggest deadlines based on task difficulty.”

“Remind me what’s due tomorrow.”

👉 Why: Adds innovation — perfect for showing you can blend AI + backend logic.
