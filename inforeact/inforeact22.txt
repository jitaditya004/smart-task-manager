1️⃣ constructor keyword

It’s a special function inside a class that runs once when the component is created.

It’s used to initialize state or bind methods.

Example:

class Counter extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props); // required to access this.props
    this.state = { count: 0 }; // initialize state
  }
}


super(props) → calls the parent class constructor (React.Component) so you can use this.props.

Anything in the constructor runs before the component is mounted on the screen.

2️⃣ componentDidMount()

This is a lifecycle method of class components.

It runs once right after the component is mounted (inserted into the DOM).

Good for:

Fetching data from a server

Setting up subscriptions

Initializing libraries

Example:

class Counter extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { count: 0 };
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    console.log("Component mounted!");
  }

  render() {
    return <h2>{this.state.count}</h2>;
  }
}


Output: "Component mounted!" appears in the console after the component appears on the page.

It runs only once, unless the component is removed and added again.

Comparison with Hooks

The equivalent of componentDidMount in a functional component is:

useEffect(() => {
  console.log("Component mounted!");
}, []); // empty dependency array → runs only once


useEffect can also replace componentDidUpdate and componentWillUnmount depending on how you use it.

If you want, I can draw a simple timeline diagram showing constructor → render → componentDidMount → updates, so it’s easy to visualize.

Do you want me to do that?

You said:
componentdidmount is a keyword?? and where did setstate came from out of nowhere?why count:this.state.count.. why the dots and this keyword ?

ChatGPT said:

Let’s break this carefully. You’ve asked a few different things, so I’ll explain each one clearly.

1️⃣ componentDidMount

It’s not a keyword, it’s a method name defined by React for class components.

React calls this method automatically after the component is mounted.

You define it yourself inside a class, and React runs it.

class Counter extends React.Component {
  componentDidMount() {
    console.log("Mounted!");
  }
}


Here, componentDidMount is just a function you write, but React knows to call it after the component appears on the page.

2️⃣ setState

setState is a method provided by React for class components.

You never define it yourself; React gives it to every class component that extends React.Component.

You use it to update the component’s state.

React then re-renders the component automatically with the new state.

Example:

this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 });


this.state.count → current value of count in the state

count: this.state.count + 1 → new value we want to set

3️⃣ Why this and dots

this → refers to the current class instance.

this.state → the state object defined in the class.

this.state.count → the count property inside the state.

The dot . is just normal JavaScript object property access.

Putting it together
class Counter extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { count: 0 }; // state object with count
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    console.log("Mounted! Count is:", this.state.count);
    this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 }); // update state
  }

  render() {
    return <h2>{this.state.count}</h2>;
  }
}


Initially count = 0

After mounting, componentDidMount runs → setState updates count → component re-renders with count = 1
